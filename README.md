# Noto
An easy to use and build Editor made with electron, using javascript, html and css. 

# Electron
[Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) is a great framework to start developing desktop programs due only use Javascript, Html and css (you can use any javascript framework or library if you want). I think once the IPC (Interprocess Communication) is understood, electron became easier to use. 

# How to use
First you will need [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (which comes with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)). When you have all the software needed, go to the command line and type:
```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/MasterEnoc/Noto.git
# Change your current directory to the cloned repository
cd Noto
# try Noto
npm start
```
# Your help is welcome
Hi everyone, I have been learning javascript and I decided to made a little project because the best way to learn coding is coding.  I didn't want it to take a lot of time but a plenty of ideas came when I was coding. I don't know all the best practices, I made changes while I was making this project, you will see some commits where I ended to implement an idea and then change its base. I would like you to help me reading my code and sending an email or contacting me to give me feedback about how I made this project, I'll be glad if you can give me suggestion or any tip.
